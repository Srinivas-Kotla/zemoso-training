Pattern:-StringBuffer class append method uses the Builder design pattern

Description:-StringBuffer inherits the abstract class AbstractStringBuilder which overrides different append methods.

Each append method takes different types of input arguments and checks for conditions to be satisfied to make the append on the given stringbuffer.

Append methods checks for ensureCapacity of the char array if else increases the array to required capacity. Also cases for appending a number and different cases of objects.

So the AbstractStringBuilder takes care of the exceptions just allowing the see it as basic appending of two objects

Other Patterns :-

An abstract factory or factory design pattern can also be used in this so each append method can be called defined on the conditions of the append being made.

Singleton pattern cannot be used here as the context of singleton is completely out of the StringBuffer append methods.

Prototype pattern cannot be used to here as the purpose of creating clones of an object has no use in this.

Decorator pattern seems to work but we have explicitly call each a class to check for different conditions based on the inputs.

Except these remaining patterns do not seem to fit in this scenario.
